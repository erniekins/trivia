# trivia

Nice little Front end application that I got from the MEAN stack while at the coding dojo. Works a bit like Jeopardy where there are three categories at different levels questions were pulled from an API and are randomized each round, the points awarded are based on difficulty, and score is kept along top until page is reloaded.

Next steps I was thinking of taking included adding a backend to keep track of scores and players so there can be a leaderboard. I would also like to make the code more dry and have the ability to either choose your own categories or randomize the category.
